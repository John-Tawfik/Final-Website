Brag Sheet:Food Bank volunteer, XC + Track, Orchestra

Food Bank: I started volunteering at Aldersgate food bank a few months ago, before quarantine started. It was handing food out to people who needed government assistance with food, and sorting the shipments of food that they would receive along with donated clothes.

XC + Track: I started running in 8th grade with coach Carney, then I stuck with the sport and still run. I run XC in the fall, then winter track, and spring.

Orchestra: I started Orchestra in 4th grade, and I played the Viola. I plan to stick with it to the end of senior year.
